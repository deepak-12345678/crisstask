            Currently a CSE freshman at BITS Pilani, my hobbies include playing
            badminton and chess. I also like to listen punjabi song and I also
            like to dance along with my friend. I have been focusing on coding
            (Web Dev and a little bit of Competitive, to be precise) nowadays. I
            hope you like this website!

            I did my primary schooling at Vivek Summit school, in Delhi. Then I
            went to Manav Sthali School and I was there form class III to XII.
            Apart from them, I have been a student of VMC as well, where I spent
            two years preparing for my enggineering examinations. Currently, I
            am a part of one of India's best colleges, BITS Pilani, and I'm
            still trying every day to skill myself up.

            I love talking to people; hence, I can understand languages like
            Punjabi, Hindi, English, French etc to a large extent. I am more
            comfortable with Hindi or English in daily routines.

            I was an active student council member in the school (as the
            Cultural Head for the term) and managed the whole cultural dept. As
            a result, all big-and-small events were conducted by my team only.
            The footfall of our Annual Day celebrations touched 800 in a day!
            Apart from my management skills, I am confident in my academic and
            interactive skills that I can conduct any task given to me in the
            asked amount of time. My experience in coding stood nil till I
            joined BITS. However, I have developed my skills to a decent level
            within a short span. Coding was one of the main reasons I chose CSE
            over other branches, and I want to be committed to it in whatever
            way possible. Other experiences would include the certificates I
            received during my school-time and related prizes, which prove my
            dedication and hard work towards my goal.

            I have been very active in cultural and academic activities
            throughout my school life. Apart from winning multiple debates and
            contests, I was a member of the school's student council, which
            supervised students' behaviour and fests. Academically, I was among
            the topmost students in each class from KG to +2, and I feel happy
            writing 96.4 (XII) and 97.4 (X) as my CBSE Board grades. I got
            excellent AIRs in the reputed IIT-JEE examinations and have won
            various scholarships for my Olympiad and NTSE scores!
